	<h1>HamProto</h1>
	<p>HamProto is a prototyping tool that takes all of the javascript out of a prototype. Using simple css hooks, you can create a working app or website prototype using only your knowledge of html and css, and a few standard classes used by the HamProto framework. Then when you're ready, you'll actually have code created and a base to work from to create your actual app.</p>
	<p>See an example app <a href="prototyping.html">here</a>.</p>
